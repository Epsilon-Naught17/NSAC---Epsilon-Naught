        <h1>Plants and Animals</h1>
        <p2>Introduction</p2>
        <p>NASA satellites keep an eye on Earth’s water and air—which are essential for life on Earth. Some satellites can monitor plant health, too.</p>
        <h2>Sustaining Plant Life</h2>
        <p>Now that we know what Earth materials are, let's look at how they help to sustain plant life. If I wanted to grow a plant, I would first dig a hole in the ground, then plant some seeds, and water the seeds so they grow. During this process, I would be digging in soil. The soil is where the seeds are planted and what plants grow out of.

            Most types of plants cannot survive without soil to grow in. Soil not only provides a material to grow in but also transports nutrients and water to the roots of the plant. Plants need to absorb these nutrients and water in order to grow.
            
            Minerals found in the soil, such as calcium, copper, and iron, are also absorbed by the plant and are important for plant growth and structure. The rocks within soil are also very important to plants. Many plants wrap their roots around rocks in the soil, which helps anchor them in place. The rocks keep plants secure and stable.</p><br>
        <h2>Sustaining Animal Life</h2>
        <p>Earth materials also help sustain animal life on the planet.All animals rely on water for survival.Water is essential because it helps bodies funtion properly.It helps regulate body temperature,keep organs hydrated,and transports oxygen,nutrients,and waste</p>
