# NSAC---Epsilon-Naught
Spreading awareness to sustain our planet earth for future generation using technology.
Upon reading the description of our challenge , we understood that age gap and lack of information plays a key role in environmental pollution, unawareness and lifestyle attitudes. Hence we decided to build up a platform where the younger generation and the older generation alike will be interested to use it .
News seem to be the most interested medium for our previous generations and keeps them hung up while for the newer ones, they like creating and inventing stuff and try to keep it new and fresh. 
Our prototype will be a news platform which completely focuses on latest environment news, researches and studies and give tips to bring changes in their lifestyle which can help in sustaining our planet for our upcoming generation of prodigies. 
We named our web app 'smidgen' as a small change can make a big difference.
We plan to outsource the news and studies from NASA EarthData site which has a massive data of natural hazards and happening all around the world.
The reduce recycle and reuse section will be for users who want to be creative and make their own DIY products. The news section will be refreshed daily with new information.
In the two days we plan to develop the prototype and have it up and working.
