        <h1>Tips:</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>1.Recycle wherever you can</li>
            <p>We’ll admit that sometimes we forget to recycle in our homes, but recycling is probably the easiest and most important thing you can do. Recycling makes a huge difference for the planet. It’s worth the extra second it takes to rinse the milk or yogurt container and throw it in the blue bin. Check out this basic guide for what can be recycled.</p><br>
            <li>2.Take shorter showers and use less water</li>
            <p>Small things add up! One way to conserve water is by taking shorter showers. But if speedy bathing isn't for you, try lessening water usage in other ways. Use the dishwasher less often by waiting until it is packed full, or rinse lightly used items like cups by hand. If you use sprinklers, try watering the grass less often.</p><br>
            <li>3.Repurpose instead of throwing away</li>
            <p>This is our favorite because it means getting creative. It’s likely that many of the items in your house can be repurposed. At Prosperity Candle, we always design with repurposing in mind. Our Liberte Pot and Marbella Collection both become beautiful flower planters once the candle is finished for a lifetime of enjoyment (we include wildflower seeds).</p>
            <li>4.Choose paperless bills and statements</li>
            <p>This one is super easy! Save trees and reduce paper waste by having your internet, electricity, doctor, and other bills sent to you electronically. Most companies offer a paperless option and you'll love how much less mail piles up. If you’re a business owner, consider moving your office over to paperless.</p><br>
            <li>5.Pick in-season fruits and vegetables</li>
            <p>Buying groceries in season is good for your body and the environment, plus it’s cheaper. Choosing local fruit and vegetables means less energy needed to transport and a smaller carbon footprint. Try shopping at farmers’ markets or choosing produce from local growers. You might find you're more inspired to cook yummy meals that make a great work lunch the next day, and you save on the plastic waste that comes with takeout.</p>
            <li>6. Reusable water bottles and bags</li>
            <p>We've all heard this sustainability tip repeatedly, but it's AMAZING how many disposable water bottles there still are. Instead, simply invest in your own stylish and reusable bottle. Love Bottle donates 5% of every purchase to Global Water to help get clean water to those in need. Throw-away plastic is one of the worst pollutants because it doesn’t break down or decompose into nature. But it does release toxic chemicals into the air and kill wildlife, so just avoid it altogether.</p>
            <li>7. Walk or bike locally instead of driving</li>
            <p>This one is often just a matter of building in the extra time to get places. And now that spring is here, it's so much nicer to walk or bike instead of going around in a car. You help reduce emissions while enjoying the sun, and it's an especially great option for those short trips to the corner store. Want to shrink your carbon footprint even more? Consider carpooling or taking public transportation to work every once in a while.</p>
