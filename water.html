        <h1>Water</h1>
        <p2>Introduction</p2>
        <p>Water is essential for life on Earth. From oceans to rivers to clouds in the sky, NASA satellites are observing where Earth’s water is found--and how that is changing over time.</p><br>
        <p>Water is so commonplace that we often take it for granted. But too much – or too little of it – makes headlines.</p><br>
        <p>Whether concerned with floods, droughts, or the status and quality of water supplies, addressing the water-related needs of humans on Earth starts with knowing where the water is. With unique views from space, NASA is at the forefront of studying and monitoring this most precious resource that is constantly on the move. Researchers use data from satellites, aircraft, and other efforts, to find out where and when water is available around the globe, how much, and how are those patterns changing. They then figure out how to best use that data and get it into the hands of the people who need it most. </p><br>
